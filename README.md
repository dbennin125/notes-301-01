<h2>Solving Problems</h2>
<p>My main take away from this article was understand the problem. If you do not understand the problem(or what the problme is asking), ask and try to figure out the problem. I also enjoyed the point about simplifying the problem and break it down to an easier solve.<br> Another valid point was to think before you code. Write out some psuedo-code and then once everything is solved and write finally write the code. It is better to have things planned out and the problem solved before you actually write the code.<br>Another valuable point that if you understand how to solve the problem but are unaware on how to execute, you may not know the language and it is beneficial to brush up on that as well.</p>
<h2>Act Like you make $1000/hr</h2>
<p>Ok, this was a really great article. I can relate to this post because I feel incredibly stretched thin time wise. I am staying focused but I fall into the trap of not putting a stopping point on a task on enjoying my free time.<br>I also think it's a good idea to realize that time is valuable and you aren't getting any more of it. You aren't paid in time, you can't create more time. You can't allow everyone to take away your time and still have time left over for yourself, it doesn't work that way (for extended periods of time)</p>
<h2>How to think like a programmer</h2>
<p>This article was a good read. I think my main take aways are that you need to understand what the problem is...if you can't explain the problem, you should stop and find a way to explain the problem until it makes sense. You should then plan I enjoyed the "Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?" I like that line and will definitely come back to it. <br> As noted with the previous article, it is better to simplify the problem, another way is to make the problem into smaller subsets, solve those one by one. <b>After all the sub-problems are solved, you go back and put it all together so that it solves the original problem.</b>It's called the reduce the problem technique.<br>If you've reduced the problem down and still aren't able to get the sub-answer, Debug, Reassess(possibly change your approach/starting over), research. Also get in the habit of solving small problems everyday...it will help build up your problem solving brain power.</p>
<h2>The 5 whys and hows</h2>
When to use: the <i>why's</i> when you want to explore a problem.<br>
The <i>how's</i> when you want to explore a more details solution.<br>
How it's done:
Step 1. Draw a box at the top and clearly express the problem or solution you want investigate.<br>

Step 2. Below the statement box draw five lines.<br>

Step 3. Ask "why" or "how" five times and write answers on lines drawn from 1-5.<br>

Step 4. This may be more or less than 5 times, you repeat until you find the root cause or the soloution to the problem.
