<h2>Solving Problems</h2>
<p>My main take away from this article was understand the problem. If you do not understand the problem(or what the problme is asking), ask and try to figure out the problem. I also enjoyed the point about simplifying the problem and break it down to an easier solve.<br> Another valid point was to think before you code. Write out some psuedo-code and then once everything is solved and write finally write the code. It is better to have things planned out and the problem solved before you actually write the code.<br>Another valuable point that if you understand how to solve the problem but are unaware on how to execute, you may not know the language and it is beneficial to brush up on that as well.</p>
<h2>Act Like you make $1000/hr</h2>
<p>Ok, this was a really great article. I can relate to this post because I feel incredibly stretched thin time wise. I am staying focused but I fall into the trap of not putting a stopping point on a task on enjoying my free time.<br>I also think it's a good idea to realize that time is valuable and you aren't getting any more of it. You aren't paid in time, you can't create more time. You can't allow everyone to take away your time and still have time left over for yourself, it doesn't work that way (for extended periods of time)</p>
